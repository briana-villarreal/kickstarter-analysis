# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Lousie, my client, desires to start a crowdfunding campaign for her theater play "Fever" and has estimated budget of over $10,000. She plans to launch her play in the U.S. She would like to know which factors make a project campaign most successful from start to finish. She is particularly interested in seeing how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I analyzed outcomes based on launch date by creating a pivot table with filters based on the Parent Category, "theater", and "years". I ensured that column lables showed "successful", "failed", and "canceled" outcomes. I named the column rows as months of the year.

I created a line chart from the pivot table to visualize the relationship between outcomes and months. Upon examination of the line chart, I found that the majority of campaigns regardless of their outcome are launched in the month of May. Likewise, campaigns are rarely launched in the months of September and December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I analyzed outcomes based on goals by using COUNTIFS() functions to populate the "Number Successful", "Number Failed", and "Number Canceled" columns by filtering on the Kickstarter "outcome" column, on the "goal" amount column using the ranges of goals created, and on the "Subcategory" column using "plays" as the criteria. I used the SUM() function to populate the "Total Projects" column for each row. I then calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row.

I created a line chart to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis. Upon examination of the line chart, I found that the percentage canceled was equal to zero regardless of the goal. Moreover, I found that the percentage of failed campaigns was highest when the goal amount exceeded $45,000. I found that the percentage of successful campaigns was highest when the goal amount was less than $1000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Throughout my analysis, I encountered challenges regarding the Outcomes Based on Goal deliverable. When populating the "Number Successful", "Number Failed", and "Number Canceled" columns, I utilized the COUNTIFS() function. For the second row, I encountered difficulties as I originally did not subtract the preceding row from my argument. It is necessary to subtract preceding amounts to capture only the data within the specified goal range.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? I conclude that the best months to launch a successful campaign are May and June. I further conclude that a campaign should not be launched in December as it is the least likely month where a campaign garners success.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? I conclude that the percentage of successful campaigns is highest when the goal is less than $1000 and thereby my client should lower her goal amount. When the goal is between $45,000 and $49,999, campaigns will experience a 100% failed outcome. Therefore, I conclude that it is best to have a moderate or limited goal amount to achieve a successful outcome. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset? A major limitation of this dataset is the lack of details regarding the backers who supported the campaigns. I think it would be helpful to know their own annual salary or socioeconomic status to determine the audience that my client, Lousie, should target. Additionally, I believe that there should be data related to the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of the listed countries. This value displays the relative costs of local goods, services, and inflation rates of the country and is thereby an accurate measure in assesing the domestic market. Having such a variable in the dataset would allow conclusions to be drawn regarding how likely citizens of various countries would contribute to a campaign.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? A table or graph that could be created to strengthen the analysis would compare the number of backers to the outcome of a campaign. This would allow important insights to be drawn regarding the intended audience of a campaign. Another table or graph could also be created to compare the Staff Pick with the outcome of a campaign. This would allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the publicization of a campaign and its likelihood of success.
